# picture-this-backend

Backend for Graphical Password using Image Segmentation system is a Springboot app.

This project is meant to serve as a demo, no real security measures are applied (no tokenizing, no protection against CSRF, no email verification etc..) 
therefor it's not meant for production in it's current state. 

Also this project is ongoing an will be improved, feedback is appreciated :)


When cloning this repo make sure that the backend folder is the source root when opened in an IDE.
